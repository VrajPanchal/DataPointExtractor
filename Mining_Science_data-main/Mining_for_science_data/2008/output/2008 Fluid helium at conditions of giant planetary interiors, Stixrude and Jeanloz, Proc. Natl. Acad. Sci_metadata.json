Dotted line shows the difference in density at 20,000 K between our calculations and the plasma model (22). Comparison with LAPW calculations show that PAW is accurate to at least 300 Mbar, whereas at 1 Gbar, PAW overestimates the pressure by 10%. Our calculated equation of state of fluid helium is in good agreement with a path-integral Monte Carlo study at lower densities and higher temperatures (45) and a density-functional moleculardynamics study at lower temperature and pressure (40)."

The blue solid line represents the closure of the electronic energy gap, and purple dotted lines are the conditions at which the He concentration reaches 10% (labeled ''onset'') and 50% (labeled ''PI'') of pressure ionization in the plasma model (22).
