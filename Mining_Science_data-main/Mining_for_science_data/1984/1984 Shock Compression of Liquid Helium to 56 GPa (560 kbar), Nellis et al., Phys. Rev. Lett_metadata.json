Calculations with four different pair potentials are compared with the single-shock data, but only the best two potentials are compared with the double-shock point. The open circle on the theoretical curve at 55 GPa is the double-shock point predicted by the theory for the experimental conditionss (10 GP a = 100 k bar) ."
